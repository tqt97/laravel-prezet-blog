Laravel provides several different approaches to validate your application's incoming data. Ensuring data is valid before storing it is crucial for application integrity.

## Basic Validation with Controllers

The most common way is using the `validate` method available on `Illuminate\Http\Request` objects within your controller methods.

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

public function store(Request $request)
{
    $validated = $request->validate([
        'title' => 'required|unique:posts|max:255',
        'body' => 'required',
        'publish_at' => 'nullable|date',
    ]);

    // The blog post is valid... proceed with storing
}
```

If validation fails, Laravel automatically redirects the user back to the previous location (usually a form) with the validation errors flashed to the session. For AJAX requests, it returns a JSON response with a 422 status code.

## Form Requests for Complex Validation

For more complex validation scenarios, you can create dedicated Form Request classes. These classes contain their own validation and authorization logic.

```bash
php artisan make:request StorePostRequest
```

Then, type-hint the request in your controller method:

```php
use App\Http\Requests\StorePostRequest;

public function store(StorePostRequest $request)
{
    // The incoming request is valid...
    // Retrieve the validated input data...
    $validated = $request->validated();
}
```

Laravel offers a wide range of [built-in validation rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules), and you can also [create your own custom rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#custom-validation-rules).
